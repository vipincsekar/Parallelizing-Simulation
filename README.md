Introduction:
   A simulation is an imitation of the operation of a real-world process or system. The act of simulating something first requires that a      model be developed this model represents the key characteristics, behaviors and functions of the selected physical or abstract system or    process. The model represents the system itself, whereas the simulation represents the operation of the system over time.
  Simulation is used in many contexts, such as simulation of technology for performance optimization, safety engineering, testing,           training, education, and video games. Often, computer experiments are used to study simulation models. Simulation is also used with         scientific modelling of natural systems or human systems to gain insight into their functioning, as in economics.
  
 Applications of Simulation: Experimentation, Operational Planning, Training, Missions Rehearsal, Support to the Conduct of Operations,                                   Life Cycle Management.

Parallelization:

Parallel (distributed) simulation refers to the technology concerned with executing computer simulations over computing systems containing multiple processors – Tightly coupled multiprocessor systems – Workstations interconnected via a network (e.g., the Internet) – Handheld computers with wireless links.

The process of simulation can be parallelized by using parallel techniques and the process could be made efficient and also time consuming could be managed.

Methodology: Openmpi, C-Programming.

In this project, twenty random numbers had been generated for Inter-arrival time and Service Time. In which random numbers are being parallelized into two parts such as ten numbers each. Then the simulation process is being done and average idle time and waiting time is being founded.
